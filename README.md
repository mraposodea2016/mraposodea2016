Hello there,

Here you'll find some work I've been doing to advance my knowledge of Data Science and Full Stack Development.

I've been using the following resources to guide learning and projects:
- for Machine Learning
  - <i>Mathematics for Machine Learning, by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong</i>
  - <i>An Introduction to Statistical Learning, by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani</i>,
  - and <i>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron</i>
- for Full Stack Development
  - <i>Modern Full Stack Development, by Frank Zammetti</i>

Feel free to reach out if you are willing to collaborate on any project related to the above areas.

I'm also active on <a href=https://www.hackerrank.com/matheus_raposo>HackerRank<a>.
