Hello there,

My focus has been directed to advancing my knowledge of Data Science, to be able to develop more scalable and useful software solutions.

Lately, I've been spending most of my focus time on a few knowledge domains, including:
- Data Structures and Algorithms, based on <i>Introduction to Algorithms, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein</i>
- Machine Learning, based on 
  - <i>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron</i> 
  - and <i>Mathematics for Machine Learning, by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong</i>
- Python, based on <i>Fluent Python, by Luciano Ramalho</i>
- and Quantitative Finance, based on <i>Python for Finance, by Yves Hilpisch</i>

Moving forward, I'd be willing to collaborate, full-time or part-time, on any project related to the above areas.
