Hi there,

My focus over the next few months here is to strengthen my Computer Science foundations, to be able to develop more scalable and useful software solutions.

As of mid-February, I've been spending most of my focus time on a few specific knowledge domains, including:
- Data Structures and Algorithms, based on <i>Introduction to Algorithms, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein</i>
- Machine Learning, based on 
  - <i>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron</i> 
  - and <i>Mathematics for Machine Learning, by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong</i>
- Performance Python, based on <i>Fluent Python, by Luciano Ramalho</i>
- and Quantitative Finance, based on <i>Python for Finance, by Yves Hilpisch</i>

As a side project, I'd be more than willing to collaborate on any project related to the above areas and/or to Blockchain Development.
